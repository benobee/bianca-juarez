Carlton Ball’s Book “Pottery without a Wheel” in the back room of Silica Studios. It was like discovering Aladdin’s cave. F. Carlton-Ball was a ceramics professor who taught at various colleges on the West Coast for 50 years. He must have been the best teacher. I wish I could go back in time and be one of his groovy students in a little turtleneck, capris and flats. His book basically lays everything out for you. Do this, don’t use that, here’s how you do it. He says you should actually wipe the glaze off your pots so it only stays in the textured low-lying parts. It was a Eureka! moment for me. Paul Bellardo had visited Silica studios a few weeks before I glazed this pot and was having lunch with his friends at the table where I was working. They were very nice and chatty and I asked Paul what advice he would give me. He said I should use more texture, although he was looking at the Pot of Tears when he said it, and amended it to “But not necessarily.” So I’d been impressing all sorts of things in my pots, but no-one mentioned that if I did that, I shouldn’t cover them over with glaze. Duh! So this was my first stab at taking the glaze off after it had been put on. It came out looking like a yummy toasted marshmallow, which, come to think of it, must be why the glaze is called “Marshmallow”!</p>","customContent":null,"likeCount":0,"commentCount":0,"publicCommentCount":0,"commentState":1,"unsaved":false,"author":{"id":"5226cef1e4b0521e9330fb4d","isDeactivated":false,"deleted":false,"displayName":"MyDigitalLandscape.com","firstName":"William","lastName":"Heimbach","avatarId":"59a8732fe45a7c35313a1041","websiteUrl":"http://www.mydigitallandscape.com","bio":"Squarespace Specialists - Squarespace Training - Located in Seattle WA, MyDigitalLandscape.com - Graphic / Website Design - Creative Online Business Tools &amp;

Across from the island there was a small hill that was completely flat on top, with a curious indent smack in the middle. People said it was an old Druid Ceremonial site. I knew for sure that the Holy Grail was not buried on the Island, but was instead interred safely in the Druid hill, watched over by 2 protective swans who made their nest nearby.
